" Introduction
" ------------
"
" NOTE: This plugin is unix-only!
"
" An small vim 7.0 plugin for showing RCS diff information in a file while
" editing. This plugin runs a diff between the current buffer and the original
" file from the version control system, and shows coloured signs indicating
" where the buffer differs from the original file from the repository. The
" original text is not shown, only signs are used to indicate where changes were
" made. With proper key bindings configured, fast navigation between changed
" blocks is also provided.
"
" Despite the name 'svndiff' this plugin supports the folling RCS systems:
"
" - Subversion
" - Git
" - Mercurial
" - Perforce / p4
" - CVS
"
" The type of RCS will be detected when first issuing a svndiff command on 
" the file.
"
" The following symbols and syntax highlight groups are used for the signs:
"
"   > DiffAdd:    Newly added lines. (default=blue)
"
"   ! DiffChange: Lines which are changed from the original. (default=cyan)
"
"   < DiffDel:    Applied to the lines directly above and below a deleted block
"                 (default=magenta) 
"
" Usage
" -----
"
" The plugin defines one function: Svndiff(). This function figures out the
" difference between the current buffer and it's RCS original, and adds the
" signs at the places where the buffer differs from the original file from svn
" or git. You'll need to call this function after making changes to update the
" highlighting.
"
" The function takes one argument specifying an additional action to perform:
"
"   "prev"  : jump to the previous different block 
"   "next"  : jump to the next different block
"   "clear" : clean up all signs
"
" You might want to map some keys to run the Svndiff function. For
" example, add to your .vimrc:
"
"   noremap <F3> :call Svndiff("prev")<CR> 
"   noremap <F4> :call Svndiff("next")<CR>
"   noremap <F5> :call Svndiff("clear")<CR>
"
"
" Configuration
" -------------
"
" The following configuration variables are availabe:
" 
" * g:svndiff_autoupdate
"
"   If this variable is defined, svndiff will automatically update the signs
"   when the user stops typing for a short while, and when leaving insert
"   mode. This might slow things down on large files, so use with caution.
"   The vim variable 'updatetime' can be used to set the auto-update interval,
"   but not that changing this variable other effects as well. (refer to the 
"   vim docs for more info) 
"   To use, add to your .vimrc:
"
"   let g:svndiff_autoupdate = 1
"
" * g:svndiff_one_sign_delete
"
"   Normally, two 'delete' signs are placed around the location where
"   text was deleted. When this variable is defined, only one sign is
"   placed, above the location of the deleted text.
"   To use, add to your .vimrc:
"
"   let g:svndiff_one_sign_delete = 1
"
" Colors
" ------
"
" Personally, I find the following colours more intuitive for diff colours:
" red=deleted, green=added, yellow=changed. If you want to use these colours,
" try adding the following lines to your .vimrc
"
" hi DiffAdd      ctermfg=0 ctermbg=2 guibg='green'
" hi DiffDelete   ctermfg=0 ctermbg=1 guibg='red'
" hi DiffChange   ctermfg=0 ctermbg=3 guibg='yellow'
"
" Changelog
" ---------
"
" 1.0 2007-04-02	Initial version
"
" 1.1 2007-04-02	Added goto prev/next diffblock commands
"
" 1.2 2007-06-14  Updated diff arguments from -u0 (obsolete) to -U0
"
" 2.0 2007-08-16  Changed from syntax highlighting to using signs, thanks
"                 to Noah Spurrier for the idea. NOTE: the name of the
"                 function changed from Svndiff_show() to Svndiff(), so
"                 you might need to update your .vimrc mappings!
"
" 3.0 2008-02-02  Redesign with some ideas from Jan Bezdekovsky. The
"                 diff is only updated when the buffer actually changes,
"                 cleanup of signs is now done properly and some info
"                 about each diff block is printed in the status line.
"
" 3.1 2008-02-04  Fixed bug that broke plugin in non-english locales, thanks
"                 to Bernhard Walle for the patch
"
" 3.2 2008-02-27	The latest rewrite broke vim 6 compatiblity. The plugin
"                 is now simply disabled for older vim versions to avoid
"                 a lot of warnings when loading.
"
" 4.0 2008-11-24  Added GIT support. The RCS type is now detected (svn/git)
"
" 4.1 2008-11-25	Added CVS support.
"
" 4.2 2009-07-31	Added support for proper handling of non-unix file formats
"                 which use different newline conventions (dos, mac)
"
" 4.3 2010-05-08	Added support for Mercurial, fixed git support (thanks 
"                 Frankovskyi Bogdan)
"
" 4.4 2011-03-30	Added support for perforce/p4 (thanks, Timandahaf)
