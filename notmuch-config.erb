# .notmuch-config - Configuration file for the notmuch mail system
#
# For more information about notmuch, see http://notmuchmail.org

# Database configuration
#
# The only value supported here is 'path' which should be the top-level
# directory where your mail currently exists and to where mail will be
# delivered in the future. Files should be individual email messages.
# Notmuch will store its database within a sub-directory of the path
# configured here named ".notmuch".
#
[database]
path=<%= ENV['HOME'] %>/Mail

# User configuration
#
# Here is where you can let notmuch know how you would like to be
# addressed. Valid settings are
#
#	name		Your full name.
#	primary_email	Your primary email address.
#	other_email	A list (separated by ';') of other email addresses
#			at which you receive email.
#
# Notmuch will use the various email addresses configured here when
# formatting replies. It will avoid including your own addresses in the
# recipient list of replies, and will set the From address based on the
# address to which the original email was addressed.
